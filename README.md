# Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of cars using machine learning models. The project utilizes various features of cars such as brand, manufacturing year, kilometers driven, fuel type, transmission, mileage, engine capacity, and more to make accurate price predictions. A user-friendly **Streamlit** web application is also included, allowing users to input car details and receive a predicted price instantly.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** The dataset is thoroughly preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature extraction.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Several machine learning models, including **Linear Regression**, **Decision Tree**, and **Random Forest**, were trained and evaluated. The **Random Forest Regressor** was selected for its superior performance.
- **Interactive Web Application:** A professional and intuitive **Streamlit** app allows users to input car features and get predictions on car prices.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- Car brand (e.g., Maruti, Hyundai, Honda)
- Year of manufacture
- Kilometers driven
- Fuel type (Diesel, Petrol, CNG, etc.)
- Transmission type (Manual/Automatic)
- Ownership history (First owner, Second owner, etc.)
- Mileage, engine capacity, and max power.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
